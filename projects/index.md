We develop algorithms and processes to automatically design, develop, and assess the resilience, robustness, security electronic devices and systems. 

Our research includes topics at various stages of investigation:  advanced/novel cryptographic logic primitives (polymorphic, homomorphic, quantum-enhanced), symbiosis of AI designed constructs for AI applications, assessment and evaluation of assistive technologies on  semiconductor design and post-manufacturing operation, and development and detection methods for AI-based sabotage. 

We have opportunities for undergraduate (paid or experiential based on interest and time commitment) and graduate research (funded). Our research projects are tightly coupled with the topics listed above, but we also sponsor more applied projects which may be of interest to Senior Design Teams.
