### Undergraduate Students

Your first step to joining DRACO is applying to and getting accepted to UCF.

Undergraduate students (from Freshman to Seniors) are always welcome in DRACO. Though DRACO is new to UCF, undergraduate researchers in our prior lab (CEDAR), have been first authors on papers submitted on research that they performed.

Our expectations for undergraduate researchers are high, but we offer support, guidance, and training to those who wish to work with us! Not sure if diving into research is for you? Join our information sessions held twice a semester. Want to engage in the work but don't have the time? Consider one of our open senior design capstone projects [coming soon].

If you are an undergraduate interested in discussing research opportunities please [contact Dr. Mike]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).
