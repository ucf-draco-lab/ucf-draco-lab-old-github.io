## Novel CAD Workflows, Side Channels on Homomorphic Encryption, and Polymorphic Hardware Among Topics Unveiled

The DRACO lab is pleased to announce the presentation of work conducted by student researchers within the DRACO lab over the past several months at the **[2024 UCF Student Scholars' Symposium](https://researchweek.ucf.edu/symposium/)**. Their efforts over the past several months have culminated in the synthesis of their work for presenting at the poster sessions of the SSS. The DRACO lab, the graduate mentors ([Andey Robins](/DRACO/members/andey-robins.html) & [Jenna Goodrich](/DRACO/members/jenna-goodrich.html)), and I are all proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our individual researchers and teams. Digital versions of posters are available and linked below. For full details of the event, and to find the presentation times of our researchers, please consult [the SSS website here](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/4539/program).
