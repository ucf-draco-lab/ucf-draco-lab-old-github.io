The International Symposium on Secure and Private Execution Environment Design ([SEED](https://seed-symposium.org/2024/)) occurred May 16th and 17th at the UCF Fairwinds Alumni Center. Three researchers from the DRACO Lab had the opportunity to present their research in the undergraduate/graduate poster session on Thursday. It was a great experience to learn from professionals and fellow researchers to improve ongoing projects. The wide array of papers presented over the two days was eye-opening with topics from the security of quantum computing to termination and timing channels and more. Overall, it was an incredible opportunity to connect and learn that will help our student researchers develop current and future work.
