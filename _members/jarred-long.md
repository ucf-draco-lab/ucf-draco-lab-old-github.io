Jarred Long is a current undergraduate student at UCF, excited about ECE. 
He is  currently very interested in being involved in the development of generative AI that is trained 
to accurately design digital hardware using HDL, as well as the complications that may come along with it.
He has a great interest in learning more about hardware security and doing research involving 
performing secure/encrypted operations at the hardware levels and the issues dealing with processing time.
