  description: Develop a specification for digital system and manually implement both the design and testbench for the digital system. Using the same specification, request designs (and testbenches) from a variety of generative pre-trained transformers. Compare the resulting designs and testbenches against known solutions across various metrics.

  description: Create a block that based on orientation and manipulations performs one of several fundamental operations. When blocks are placed together they form more complex actions. Blocks should be ultra low-power and cost under five dollar per unit. End product should contain at least 25 blocks. See results from V1 completed by [PDX Senior Capstone team circa 2015](https://github.com/erebus-labs/blocks-o-code)

  description: Create a data collection plaftom that allows for basic environmental data collection for at least three different properties (e.g., temperature, weight/pressure, brightness). Trading off sensor accuracy for simplicity is critical. Platform should allow end user to input the model that converts raw data measurements into known units.

  description: Traditional sport "radars," or proximity sensors, connect to custom hardware and have limitted customizations available - develop a programmable radar device (bonus if it's bluetooth connected) which detects threats in customizable zones and provides visual and auditory alerts to both user and external entities in multi-attention grabbing non-static pulses.

- title: 3D Projection Title
  description: Develop a 2^n x 2^n Grid of RGBW+ leds that is fed from the simulation output of a cycle/turn-based multi-agent simulator. Enable connectable components to increase the grid-size. Basic version should feature fixed 3D printed topology with each unit square being illuminated via an RGB+ led - stretch goal should feature pneumatically controlled tube structures and a flexible membrane.
