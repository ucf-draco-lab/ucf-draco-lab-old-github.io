  description: Develop a specification for digital system and manually implement both the design and testbench for the digital system. Using the same specification, request designs (and testbenches) from a variety of generative pre-trained transformers. Compare the resulting designs and testbenches against known solutions across various metrics.

  description: Collect known exemplar specification, designs, and testbenches to develop a custom pre-trained transformer. If enough data is readily available also create two independent unimodal transformers - one to create designs and another to create testbenches.

- title: Blocks of Code (v2)
  subtitle: Physical block programming.

  link: https://github.com/erebus-labs/blocks-o-code
  description: Create a block that based on orientation and manipulations performs one of several fundamental operations. When blocks are placed together they form more complex actions. Blocks should be ultra low-power and cost under five dollar per unit. End product should contain at least 25 blocks. See results from V1 completed by [PDX Senior Capstone team circa 2015](https://github.com/erebus-labs/blocks-o-code)

  link: https://github.com/erebus-labs/sense_platform
  description: Create a data collection plaftom that allows for basic environmental data collection for at least three different properties (e.g., temperature, weight/pressure, brightness). Trading off sensor accuracy for simplicity is critical. Platform should allow end user to input the model that converts raw data measurments into known units.

  description: Traditional sport radars connect to custom hardware and have limitted customizations available - develop a programmable radar device (bonus if it's bluetooth connected) which detects threats in customizable zones and provides visual and auditory alerts to both user and external entities in multi-attention grabbing non-static pulses.
