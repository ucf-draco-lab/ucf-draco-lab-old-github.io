DRACO is dedicated to exploring the resilience and security of computing systems. With a team of over a dozen student researchers, our focus is on automating the design, development, and assessment of attacks, resilience, robustness, and ultimately security in electronic devices and systems.

Our research covers various areas, including the study of advanced and novel cryptographic logic primitives like polymorphic, homomorphic, and quantum-enhanced techniques. We're also involved in assessing assistive technologies on semiconductor design and post-manufacturing operation, as well as developing attack and detection methods related to electronic design-level sabotage.

Our researchers have published over 100 papers and secured funding exceeding eight million dollars from government and industry sponsors..Whether you're a part of our research team or interested in our work, we invite you to be a part of our exploration and innovation at DRACO.
