prq: Can Formal Verification Methods be applied to a unverified RISC-V processor to confirm its logical equivalence to one that is verified?

When a user buys a product, they expect that it will work how it’s supposed to. They don’t want to buy a device, provide some random sequence of inputs, and then have the device shut down forever. This type of edge-case behavior can be mitigated more emphasis on verification, a stage in development devoted to ensuring everything works as designed. The DRACO Lab is exploring a facet of this process, Formal Verification, by doing Formal Equivalence Checking on two RISC-V processors. By using an already verified processor, the team can test the unverified processors correct or incorrect behavior by mathematical proofs and compare their functionality for equivalence. The goal of this process will be to apply the Formal Verification methodology and use this knowledge to verify and correct any of the processor's functionality.
