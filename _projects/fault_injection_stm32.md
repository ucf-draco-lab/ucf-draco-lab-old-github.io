In the time of advancing autonomous vehicle technologies, the demand for secure embedded systems is increasing. The reliability of vehicle systems relies on real-time data to ensure the safety of the vehicles and its passengers. It is imperative that these systems are fortified against attacks that could compromise data integrity and the real-time operations. Widely employed in automotive applications, the STM32 Microcontroller offers a platform for a Real-Time Operating System. The focus of this research is on assessing the data integrity and real-time operations of an STM32 Microcontroller when subjected to Voltage/Fault Injection attack.
