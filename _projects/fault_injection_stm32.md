prq: Can a STM32 Microcontroller using Real Time Operating System maintain time and data integrity with a Clock Glitching Attack?

---

In the time of advancing autonomous vehicle technologies, the demand for secure embedded systems is increasing. The reliability of vehicle systems relies on real-time data to ensure the safety of the vehicles and its passengers. It is imperative that these systems are fortified against attacks that could compromise data integrity and the real-time operations. Widely employed in automotive applications, the STM32 Microcontroller offers a platform for a Real-Time Operating System. This research looks to address the question: Does the STM32 Microcontroller utilizing Real-Time Operating Systems maintain both data integrity and real-time operations when subjected to a Clock Glitching Attack?
