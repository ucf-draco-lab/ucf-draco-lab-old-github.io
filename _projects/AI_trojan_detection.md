prq: Is it possible for an AI system to detect hardware trojans?
---

The aim of this project is to assess if a hardware trojan could be detected within a large-scale system. The approach involves implementing a hardware trojan designed to periodically acquire "sensitive information." The goal is to investigate whether the AI model can detect variations in voltage power consumption and determine if can decipher when sensitive information is being leaked exactly.
